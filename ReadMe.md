## Shreyas's Numeric Routines

+ These codes are a collection of atomic data structures and plug-and-play routines written for personal projects involving computational simulation.
+ Specific applications/end-to-end pipelines may not be included in this repository.
+ Important routines and data structures are up-streamed to this repository, with relevant sources.
+ Sometime soon, Python interfaces (pybind-11) will be additionally included.

Feel free to use these as you see fit, with appropriate credit :).
